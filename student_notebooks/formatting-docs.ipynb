    "    + to do this, open the terminal (e.g., GitBash) and type `flake8 <path-to-file>`\n",
    "    + try for example in the Spyder console: `!flake8 py_scripts\\plotting.py` (using the file created during the `intro-spyder session`)\n",
    "+ for checking the code in a jupyter notebook cell, we use an extension `pycodestyle_magic`\n",
